(857, 30, 29, 'Jacob said to him, “You know how I have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care.'),
(858, 30, 30, 'The little you had before I came has increased greatly, and the Lord has blessed you wherever I have been. But now, when may I do something for my own household?”'),
(859, 30, 31, '“What shall I give you?” he asked. “Don’t give me anything,” Jacob replied. “But if you will do this one thing for me, I will go on tending your flocks and watching over them:'),
(860, 30, 32, 'Let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep, every dark-colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat. They will be my wages.'),
(861, 30, 33, 'And my honesty will testify for me in the future, whenever you check on the wages you have paid me. Any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted, or any lamb that is not dark-colored, will be considered stolen.”'),
(862, 30, 34, '“Agreed,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”'),
(863, 30, 35, 'That same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted, and all the speckled or spotted female goats (all that had white on them) and all the dark-colored lambs, and he placed them in the care of his sons.'),
(864, 30, 36, 'Then he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob, while Jacob continued to tend the rest of Laban’s flocks.'),
(865, 30, 37, 'Jacob, however, took fresh-cut branches from poplar, almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches.'),
(866, 30, 38, 'Then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs, so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink. When the flocks were in heat and came to drink,'),
(867, 30, 39, 'they mated in front of the branches. And they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted.'),
(868, 30, 40, 'Jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves, but made the rest face the streaked and dark-colored animals that belonged to Laban. Thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with Laban’s animals.'),
(869, 30, 41, 'Whenever the stronger females were in heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches,'),
(870, 30, 42, 'but if the animals were weak, he would not place them there. So the weak animals went to Laban and the strong ones to Jacob.'),
(871, 30, 43, 'In this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks, and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.'),
(872, 31, 1, 'Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying, “Jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father.”'),
(873, 31, 2, 'And Jacob noticed that Laban’s attitude toward him was not what it had been.'),
(874, 31, 3, 'Then the Lord said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”'),
(875, 31, 4, 'So Jacob sent word to Rachel and Leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were.'),
(876, 31, 5, 'He said to them, “I see that your father’s attitude toward me is not what it was before, but the God of my father has been with me.'),
(877, 31, 6, 'You know that I’ve worked for your father with all my strength,'),
(878, 31, 7, 'yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.'),
(879, 31, 8, 'If he said, ‘The speckled ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young; and if he said, ‘The streaked ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked young.'),
(880, 31, 9, 'So God has taken away your father’s livestock and has given them to me.'),
(881, 31, 10, 'In breeding season I once had a dream in which I looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked, speckled or spotted.'),
(882, 31, 11, 'The angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob.’ I answered, ‘Here I am.’'),
(883, 31, 12, 'And he said, ‘Look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked, speckled or spotted, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.'),
(884, 31, 13, 'I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me. Now leave this land at once and go back to your native land.’”'),
(885, 31, 14, 'Then Rachel and Leah replied, “Do we still have any share in the inheritance of our father’s estate?'),
(886, 31, 15, 'Does he not regard us as foreigners? Not only has he sold us, but he has used up what was paid for us.'),
(887, 31, 16, 'Surely all the wealth that God took away from our father belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you.”'),
(888, 31, 17, 'Then Jacob put his children and his wives on camels,'),
(889, 31, 18, 'and he drove all his livestock ahead of him, along with all the goods he had accumulated in Paddan Aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan.'),
(890, 31, 19, 'When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household gods.'),
(891, 31, 20, 'Moreover, Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was running away.'),
(892, 31, 21, 'So he fled with all he had, crossed the Euphrates River, and headed for the hill country of Gilead.'),
(893, 31, 22, 'On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled.'),
(894, 31, 23, 'Taking his relatives with him, he pursued Jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of Gilead.'),
(895, 31, 24, 'Then God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”'),
(896, 31, 25, 'Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of Gilead when Laban overtook him, and Laban and his relatives camped there too.'),
(897, 31, 26, 'Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You’ve deceived me, and you’ve carried off my daughters like captives in war.'),
(898, 31, 27, 'Why did you run off secretly and deceive me? Why didn’t you tell me, so I could send you away with joy and singing to the music of timbrels and harps?'),
(899, 31, 28, 'You didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters goodbye. You have done a foolish thing.'),
(900, 31, 29, 'I have the power to harm you; but last night the God of your father said to me, ‘Be careful not to say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’'),
(901, 31, 30, 'Now you have gone off because you longed to return to your father’s household. But why did you steal my gods?”'),
(902, 31, 31, 'Jacob answered Laban, “I was afraid, because I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force.'),
(903, 31, 32, 'But if you find anyone who has your gods, that person shall not live. In the presence of our relatives, see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me; and if so, take it.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the gods.'),
(904, 31, 33, 'So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and into the tent of the two female servants, but he found nothing. After he came out of Leah’s tent, he entered Rachel’s tent.'),
(905, 31, 34, 'Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel’s saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing.'),
(906, 31, 35, 'Rachel said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I’m having my period.” So he searched but could not find the household gods.'),
(907, 31, 36, 'Jacob was angry and took Laban to task. “What is my crime?” he asked Laban. “How have I wronged you that you hunt me down?'),
(908, 31, 37, 'Now that you have searched through all my goods, what have you found that belongs to your household? Put it here in front of your relatives and mine, and let them judge between the two of us.'),
(909, 31, 38, 'I have been with you for twenty years now. Your sheep and goats have not miscarried, nor have I eaten rams from your flocks.'),
(910, 31, 39, 'I did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts; I bore the loss myself. And you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night.'),
(911, 31, 40, 'This was my situation: The heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night, and sleep fled from my eyes.'),
(912, 31, 41, 'It was like this for the twenty years I was in your household. I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times.'),
(913, 31, 42, 'If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, you would surely have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands, and last night he rebuked you.”'),
(914, 31, 43, 'Laban answered Jacob, “The women are my daughters, the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks. All you see is mine. Yet what can I do today about these daughters of mine, or about the children they have borne?'),
(915, 31, 44, 'Come now, let’s make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between us.”'),
(916, 31, 45, 'So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar.'),
(917, 31, 46, 'He said to his relatives, “Gather some stones.” So they took stones and piled them in a heap, and they ate there by the heap.'),
(918, 31, 47, 'Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.'),
(919, 31, 48, 'Laban said, “This heap is a witness between you and me today.” That is why it was called Galeed.'),
(920, 31, 49, 'It was also called Mizpah, because he said, “May the Lord keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other.'),
(921, 31, 50, 'If you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters, even though no one is with us, remember that God is a witness between you and me.”'),
(922, 31, 51, 'Laban also said to Jacob, “Here is this heap, and here is this pillar I have set up between you and me.'),
(923, 31, 52, 'This heap is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me.'),
(924, 31, 53, 'May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us.” So Jacob took an oath in the name of the Fear of his father Isaac.'),
(925, 31, 54, 'He offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal. After they had eaten, they spent the night there.'),
(926, 31, 55, 'Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home.'),
(927, 32, 1, 'Jacob also went on his way, and the angels of God met him.'),
(928, 32, 2, 'When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim.'),
(929, 32, 3, 'Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom.'),
(930, 32, 4, 'He instructed them: “This is what you are to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says, I have been staying with Laban and have remained there till now.'),
(931, 32, 5, 'I have cattle and donkeys, sheep and goats, male and female servants. Now I am sending this message to my lord, that I may find favor in your eyes.’”'),
(932, 32, 6, 'When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.”'),
(933, 32, 7, 'In great fear and distress Jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups, and the flocks and herds and camels as well.'),
(934, 32, 8, 'He thought, “If Esau comes and attacks one group, the group that is left may escape.”'),
(935, 32, 9, 'Then Jacob prayed, “O God of my father Abraham, God of my father Isaac, Lord, you who said to me, ‘Go back to your country and your relatives, and I will make you prosper,’'),
(936, 32, 10, 'I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. I had only my staff when I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two camps.'),
(937, 32, 11, 'Save me, I pray, from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am afraid he will come and attack me, and also the mothers with their children.'),
(938, 32, 12, 'But you have said, ‘I will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted.’”'),
(939, 32, 13, 'He spent the night there, and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother Esau:'),
(940, 32, 14, 'two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,'),
(941, 32, 15, 'thirty female camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.'),
(942, 32, 16, 'He put them in the care of his servants, each herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go ahead of me, and keep some space between the herds.”'),
(943, 32, 17, 'He instructed the one in the lead: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going, and who owns all these animals in front of you?’'),
(944, 32, 18, 'then you are to say, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau, and he is coming behind us.’”'),
(945, 32, 19, 'He also instructed the second, the third, and all the others who followed the herds: “You are to say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.'),
(946, 32, 20, 'And be sure to say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’” For he thought, “I will pacify him with these gifts I am sending on ahead; later, when I see him, perhaps he will receive me.”'),
(947, 32, 21, 'So Jacob’s gifts went on ahead of him, but he himself spent the night in the camp.'),
(948, 32, 22, 'That night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two female servants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.'),
(949, 32, 23, 'After he had sent them across the stream, he sent over all his possessions.'),
(950, 32, 24, 'So Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him till daybreak.'),
(951, 32, 25, 'When the man saw that he could not overpower him, he touched the socket of Jacob’s hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man.'),
(952, 32, 26, 'Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”'),
(953, 32, 27, 'The man asked him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he answered.'),
(954, 32, 28, 'Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.”'),
(955, 32, 29, 'Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there.'),
(956, 32, 30, 'So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”'),
(957, 32, 31, 'The sun rose above him as he passed Peniel, and he was limping because of his hip.'),
(958, 32, 32, 'Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip, because the socket of Jacob’s hip was touched near the tendon.'),
(959, 33, 1, 'Jacob looked up and there was Esau, coming with his four hundred men; so he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two female servants.'),
(960, 33, 2, 'He put the female servants and their children in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph in the rear.'),
(961, 33, 3, 'He himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.'),
(962, 33, 4, 'But Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him; he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him. And they wept.'),
(963, 33, 5, 'Then Esau looked up and saw the women and children. “Who are these with you?” he asked. Jacob answered, “They are the children God has graciously given your servant.”'),
(964, 33, 6, 'Then the female servants and their children approached and bowed down.'),
(965, 33, 7, 'Next, Leah and her children came and bowed down. Last of all came Joseph and Rachel, and they too bowed down.'),
(966, 33, 8, 'Esau asked, “What’s the meaning of all these flocks and herds I met?” “To find favor in your eyes, my lord,” he said.'),
(967, 33, 9, 'But Esau said, “I already have plenty, my brother. Keep what you have for yourself.”'),
(968, 33, 10, '“No, please!” said Jacob. “If I have found favor in your eyes, accept this gift from me. For to see your face is like seeing the face of God, now that you have received me favorably.'),
(969, 33, 11, 'Please accept the present that was brought to you, for God has been gracious to me and I have all I need.” And because Jacob insisted, Esau accepted it.'),
(970, 33, 12, 'Then Esau said, “Let us be on our way; I’ll accompany you.”'),
(971, 33, 13, 'But Jacob said to him, “My lord knows that the children are tender and that I must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young. If they are driven hard just one day, all the animals will die.'),
(972, 33, 14, 'So let my lord go on ahead of his servant, while I move along slowly at the pace of the flocks and herds before me and the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”'),
(973, 33, 15, 'Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my men with you.” “But why do that?” Jacob asked. “Just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”'),
(974, 33, 16, 'So that day Esau started on his way back to Seir.'),
(975, 33, 17, 'Jacob, however, went to Sukkoth, where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place is called Sukkoth.'),
(976, 33, 18, 'After Jacob came from Paddan Aram, he arrived safely at the city of Shechem in Canaan and camped within sight of the city.'),
(977, 33, 19, 'For a hundred pieces of silver, he bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, the plot of ground where he pitched his tent.'),
(978, 33, 20, 'There he set up an altar and called it El Elohe Israel.'),
(979, 34, 1, 'Now Dinah, the daughter Leah had borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land.'),
(980, 34, 2, 'When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of that area, saw her, he took her and raped her.'),
(981, 34, 3, 'His heart was drawn to Dinah daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her.'),
(982, 34, 4, 'And Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this girl as my wife.”'),
(983, 34, 5, 'When Jacob heard that his daughter Dinah had been defiled, his sons were in the fields with his livestock; so he did nothing about it until they came home.'),
(984, 34, 6, 'Then Shechem’s father Hamor went out to talk with Jacob.'),
(985, 34, 7, 'Meanwhile, Jacob’s sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious, because Shechem had done an outrageous thing in Israel by sleeping with Jacob’s daughter—a thing that should not be done.'),
(986, 34, 8, 'But Hamor said to them, “My son Shechem has his heart set on your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife.'),
(987, 34, 9, 'Intermarry with us; give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves.'),
(988, 34, 10, 'You can settle among us; the land is open to you. Live in it, trade in it, and acquire property in it.”'),
(989, 34, 11, 'Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and I will give you whatever you ask.'),
(990, 34, 12, 'Make the price for the bride and the gift I am to bring as great as you like, and I’ll pay whatever you ask me. Only give me the young woman as my wife.”'),
(991, 34, 13, 'Because their sister Dinah had been defiled, Jacob’s sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to Shechem and his father Hamor.'),
(992, 34, 14, 'They said to them, “We can’t do such a thing; we can’t give our sister to a man who is not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us.'),
(993, 34, 15, 'We will enter into an agreement with you on one condition only: that you become like us by circumcising all your males.'),
(994, 34, 16, 'Then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves. We’ll settle among you and become one people with you.'),
(995, 34, 17, 'But if you will not agree to be circumcised, we’ll take our sister and go.”'),
(996, 34, 18, 'Their proposal seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.'),
(997, 34, 19, 'The young man, who was the most honored of all his father’s family, lost no time in doing what they said, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter.'),
(998, 34, 20, 'So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to the men of their city.'),
(999, 34, 21, '“These men are friendly toward us,” they said. “Let them live in our land and trade in it; the land has plenty of room for them. We can marry their daughters, and they can marry ours.'),
(1000, 34, 22, 'But the men will agree to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised, as they themselves are.'),
(1001, 34, 23, 'Won’t their livestock, their property and all their other animals become ours? So let’s agree to their terms, and they will settle among us.”'),
(1002, 34, 24, 'All the men who went out of the city gate agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem, and every male in the city was circumcised.'),
(1003, 34, 25, 'Three days later, while all of them were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city, killing every male.'),
(1004, 34, 26, 'They put Hamor and his son Shechem to the sword and took Dinah from Shechem’s house and left.'),
(1005, 34, 27, 'The sons of Jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where their sister had been defiled.'),
(1006, 34, 28, 'They seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields.'),
(1007, 34, 29, 'They carried off all their wealth and all their women and children, taking as plunder everything in the houses.'),
(1008, 34, 30, 'Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me obnoxious to the Canaanites and Perizzites, the people living in this land. We are few in number, and if they join forces against me and attack me, I and my household will be destroyed.”'),
(1009, 34, 31, 'But they replied, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”'),
(1010, 35, 1, 'Then God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel and settle there, and build an altar there to God, who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau.”'),
(1011, 35, 2, 'So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods you have with you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes.'),
(1012, 35, 3, 'Then come, let us go up to Bethel, where I will build an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever I have gone.”'),
(1013, 35, 4, 'So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears, and Jacob buried them under the oak at Shechem.'),
(1014, 35, 5, 'Then they set out, and the terror of God fell on the towns all around them so that no one pursued them.'),

(1274, 43, 7, 'They replied, “The man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family. ‘Is your father still living?’ he asked us. ‘Do you have another brother?’ We simply answered his questions. How were we to know he would say, ‘Bring your brother down here’?”'),
(1275, 43, 8, 'Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the boy along with me and we will go at once, so that we and you and our children may live and not die.'),

(1307, 44, 6, 'When he caught up with them, he repeated these words to them.'),
(1308, 44, 7, 'But they said to him, “Why does my lord say such things? Far be it from your servants to do anything like that!'),
(1309, 44, 8, 'We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks. So why would we steal silver or gold from your master’s house?'),

(1311, 44, 10, '“Very well, then,” he said, “let it be as you say. Whoever is found to have it will become my slave; the rest of you will be free from blame.”'),
(1312, 44, 11, 'Each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it.'),
